I developed an accessibility tool for gaze control of Windows computers requiring only a webcam in C++ using OpenCV.
Designed and implemented system from the very beginning together with the founder, from a single file operating at 8 frames per second to running subsystems concurrently at 30 FPS  
Introduced CMake as build system and a custom Docker image to set up CI on Bitbucket to maintain a working state on the main branch
Replaced OpenCV based tracking of facial features with a model from Google’s MediaPipe to keep track when the user’s head turns which enabled using the software as head control
