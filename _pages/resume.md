We built a new project in the medical space from scratch, I worked on the **Elixir** backend. 

### What I learned
- how to structure projects properly, which responsibility we address in which layer
- **Phoenix** as a web framework, **LiveView** for our admin interface and **Absinthe** for a GraphQL API 
- how to schedule mails using **Oban** and a lot about handling data with **Ecto**

- how to do data migrations in complex production setups

## Treye Tech

Working Student, Mar 2020 – Aug 2022

### What I worked on
We developed an accessibility tool for gaze control of Windows computers from scratch.
The tool requires only a regular webcam, which makes it stand out among competitors.
We built on top of **OpenCV** and developed in **C++**.

### What I learned
- a lot about **C++** and **OpenCV**
- a lot about build systems, **CMake** in particular
- how to work with **Docker** and set up a **CI** pipeline
- how to improve performance with concurrency, we went from 8 frames per seconds to 30, the limit of the webcam

## Caterpillar Energy Solutions

Working Student, Nov 2018 – Nov 2019

### What I worked on
I ported a remote control tool for a gas turbine control simulation test stand from **Python** to **C#** to integrate with existing software testing systems.

### What I learned
- how to apply software patterns
- testing is an extremely important part of software development

# Education

## TU Delft

M. Sc. Management of Technology, Sept 2020 – Apr 2023


### What is it about
A really diverse study program, that's at the intersection of technology and sociology.
It has three different levels:

First, an abstract, scientific view on technology.
Here, we learned how technologies evolve, how standards emerge, why we're still not all driving in eletric cars, and that there has been a quite similar transition phase in history when steamships coexisted with sailing ships.

Second, technology and innovation from a company's perspective.
This part is about how to select technologies and how to organize to employ them in an innovative way.

Last, technology and innovation from a government's perspective.
We studied how governments can foster innovation and protect niche technologies to help companies capture the markets of the future.
It's also about technological clusters and their impact on societies.
