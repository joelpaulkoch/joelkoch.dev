# Devlogs

I got the idea to write a dev diary from this talk and want to try it.

<div class="frame max-inline-size:measure">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8OUyP9p_CNc?si=AWLkALaesx3GMWND" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

I prefer the term "devlog", so I'm going with that.
I'm not sure yet what I'm going to publish, it might be summaries of a number of weeks.
I think I will keep a running note and publish it after some while. 

## Current Plan

### What am I working on?
Summarize the major things I'm working on for this devlog.

### Difficulties
What is hard to do?

### Observations
What did I learn that was interesting?
Which were the tradeoffs I made?

### Questions
What do I want to figure out?

Let's see how it goes.
